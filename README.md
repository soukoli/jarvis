## How to Use

1. **Cmd+;** - Start recording (customizable in Settings)

## Permission Setup

**Required:** Input Monitoring (for global hotkeys)

1. Open **System Settings**
2. Go to **Privacy & Security** → **Input Monitoring**
3. Add **Terminal** (or Python)
4. **Quit Terminal** completely (Cmd+Q)
5. Reopen and run `./run.sh`

**Without permission:**
- Hotkeys won't work
- Menu bar buttons still work fine!

## Example Usage

**In Claude Code:**
```
Cmd+;  → "Create a React authentication component"
Cmd+'  → [hear "ding"]
Cmd+V  → Text appears in chat
```

**In VS Code:**
```
Cmd+;  → "Add error handling for null values"
Cmd+'  → [wait for "ding"]
Cmd+V  → Text appears at cursor
```

**Anywhere:**
- Browser search
- Email
- Slack
- Documentation

## Troubleshooting

**Hotkeys not working?**
1. Grant Input Monitoring permission (see above)
2. Verify: `ps aux | grep Jarvis` (should show process)
3. Restart Terminal and run `./run.sh`

**Poor Czech/multilingual recognition?**
1. Go to **Settings → Download Better Model**
2. Download `large-v3-turbo` (takes 5-10 min)
3. Restart app to use new model
4. See `MULTILINGUAL-IMPROVEMENTS.md` for details

**No transcription or wrong text?**
- Check terminal for microphone device being used
- Select different microphone in **Settings**
- Verify whisper: `./whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli --version`
- Check logs for "Max amplitude" - should be >100

**Microphone not found after reconnecting?**
- App saves microphone by **name**, not number
- If unplugged, auto-switches to available device
- Select preferred mic again in **Settings** when reconnected

**Library errors after moving folder?**
- Run `./setup.sh` again to rebuild whisper.cpp
- Fixes dynamic library paths

**Want custom hotkeys?**
- Go to **Settings → Change Hotkeys**
- Enter two characters (e.g., `p o` for Cmd+p / Cmd+o)
- Restart app for changes to take effect

## Technical Details

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Menu Bar UI** | rumps |
| **Hotkeys** | pynput (global keyboard listener) |
| **Audio** | pyaudio (16kHz mono WAV) |
| **Transcription** | whisper.cpp (optimized: 8 threads, beam 3) |
| **Workflow** | Voice → STT → Clipboard → Manual paste |

**Why clipboard?** macOS blocks keyboard automation for security. Clipboard workflow is reliable and works everywhere.

**Model Priority:**
1. large-v3-turbo (best for Czech/multilingual)
2. large-v3 (highest quality)
3. medium (good quality)
4. base (faster, less accurate)

**Storage:**
- Recordings: `.voice_cache/` (auto-keeps last 5)
- Settings: `~/.jarvis_config.json` (mic, language, hotkeys, sound)
